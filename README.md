keybox
======

A simple password manager server written in *Python* using *Flask* and *MongoDB*. A simple shell client is included in the repository.

How to install
--------------

It's pretty simple to get up and running, follow theese steps:

- Download or clone the repository
- Make your *config* file or use the `config-test.ini` provided
- run `python setup.py` from the `app/` directory

TODO
--------------
A lot of things actually... the first one if you like to use it is crypt and decrypt for password stored in the DB. Hope to do it quickly!
